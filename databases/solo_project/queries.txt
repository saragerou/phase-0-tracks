1) Display the information in one table (either table is fine).

SELECT * FROM students;

2) Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

UPDATE students SET teacher = 3 WHERE name="Sara";

3) Display the information in both tables using one query.

SELECT * FROM students, teachers WHERE students.teacher = teachers.id;

4) Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.

SELECT students.name, teachers.teacher_name FROM students JOIN teachers on students.teacher = teachers.id;

5) Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

DELETE FROM students WHERE name = "George";
