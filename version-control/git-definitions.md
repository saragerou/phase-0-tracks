# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
* What is a merge conflict?

* Version control is ensuring that when multiple changes are being made on a file/project, that they can all be merged back together again. it is useful so that multiple people can work on a project simultaneously without using the same file.
* A branch is a separate area for work to be done on a master document without having to work in the master document. Branches are useful so that you can commit versions of work and avoid unfixable mistakes. In other words, you can roll back to any committed point in order to correct your code.
* A commit is essentially a save to a repository. A good commit code details what changes were made to a version of a document. It would allow the programmer to roll back to a very specific place in time when a change was made if there were corrections to be made.
* A merge conflict occurs when a merge is attempted between branches and the merge is not possible. Perhaps there were two people coding on the same line and the information conflicts. The merge will not be successful.
