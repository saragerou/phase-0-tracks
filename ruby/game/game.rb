# One user can enter a word (or phrase, if you would like your 
# game to support that), and another user attempts to guess the word.
# Guesses are limited, and the number of guesses available is related 
# to the length of the word.
# Repeated guesses do not count against the user.
# The guessing player receives continual feedback on the current state 
# of the word. So if the secret word is "unicorn", the user will start 
# out seeing something like "_ _ _ _ _ _ _", which would become "_ _ _ c _ _ _" 
# after the user enters a guess of "c".
# The user should get a congratulatory message if they win, and a 
# taunting message if they lose.
